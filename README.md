Hitwicket Software Developer Assignment

Levels Completed - 3

I have followed a different approach.

1. First you have to input all characters of Team A.
2. Then input all characters of Team B.
3. The resultant board is displayed.
4. Now it asks you which character of Team A would you want to move.
5. Then the move you want to make with the selected character.
6. The character is updated and the updated board is displayed.
7. Now it asks you which character of Team B would you want to move.
8. Then the move you want to make with the selected character.
9. The character is updated and the updated board is displayed.
10. This loop goes on infinitely.

To keep it simple, right-left direction are measured from one perspective only, i.e. both Player A and Player B have same left and right. 
But the forward and back are of respective player's side.

The game is still in development :)
